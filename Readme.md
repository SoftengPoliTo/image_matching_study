# Feature Matching-based Approaches to Improve the Robustness of Android Visual GUI Testing


- The repository contains the code to execute two feature matching-based approaches for widget detection in VGT scripts, and the raw data for the analyses reported in the paper *Feature Matching-based Approaches to Improve the Robustness of Android Visual GUI Testing* 
  by Ardito Luca, Bottino Andrea, Coppola Riccardo , Lamberti Fabrizio, Manigrasso Francesco, Morra Lia, Torchiano Marco.
  
- Download the repository with, for example, `git clone https://github.com/SoftengPoliTo/image_matching_study.git`.


## RQ1

- It contains the R script to reproduce the analyses pertaining RQ1
    - `Evaluation` it contains the scripts to reproduce example of the SIFT features matching with FULLSCREEN and CROPPED methods
    
    
## RQ2

- It contains the R script to reproduce the analyses pertaining RQ2
## How to evaluate the Cropped algorithm with SIFT

```sh
$ python evaluation_script.py --cropped 
```

## How to evaluate the FullScreen algorithm with SIFT

```sh
$ python evaluation_script.py  
```
