# Feature Matching-based Approaches to Improve the Robustness of Android Visual GUI Testing


- The repository contains the code to implement two feature matching-based approaches for widget detection in VGT scripts.
  
- All the material in the repository is the implementation of the paper *Feature Matching-based Approaches to Improve the Robustness of Android Visual GUI Testing* 
  by Ardito Luca, Bottino Andrea, Coppola Riccardo , Lamberti Fabrizio, Manigrasso Francesco, Morra Lia, Torchiano Marco.

## RQ1

- It contains the R script to reproduce the Research question 1 performance
    - `Evaluation` it contains the scripts to reproduce example of the SIFT features matching with FULLSCREEN and CROPPED methods
    
    
## RQ2

- It contains the R script to reproduce the Research question 2 performance
    - `Evaluation` it contains the scripts to reproduce example of the SIFT features matching with FULLSCREEN and CROPPED methods
